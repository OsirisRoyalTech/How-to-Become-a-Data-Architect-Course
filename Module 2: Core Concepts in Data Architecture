2.1 Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases
  Relational Databases (RDBMS): Use structured query language (SQL) and store data in tables with predefined schemas. E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL.
  Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL): Store unstructured or semi-structured data. E.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase.
  When to Use Each:
  Relational databases are best for structured data and complex queries.
  Non-relational databases are ideal for large-scale unstructured data, fast read/write operations, or horizontally scalable applications.

2.2 Data Warehousing
  Definition: A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores data from multiple sources, optimized for analytical querying.
  Popular Tools: Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.
  Real-World Example: A retail company integrates data from different sales channels (website, in-store, third-party platforms) into a data warehouse to perform aggregated reporting.

2.3 ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
  Process Overview:
  Extract: Collect data from different sources.
  Transform: Clean, format, and transform the data for analysis.
  Load: Load the transformed data into a data warehouse or another destination.
  Tools: Apache Kafka, Talend, Informatica, Apache NiFi.
  Example: Integrating transactional data from multiple systems (e.g., inventory management, customer database) into a unified reporting platform.
