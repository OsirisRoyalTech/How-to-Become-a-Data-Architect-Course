1.1 What is Data Architecture?
  Definition: Data Architecture refers to the design of data systems and processes to manage data flow, storage, and analysis in an organization.
  Key responsibilities of a Data Architect:
  Design and structure databases and data systems.
  Optimize data storage and access.
  Ensure data consistency, security, and integrity.
  Collaborate with data engineers, analysts, and stakeholders to meet business requirements.

1.2 Data Architect vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist
  Data Architect: Designs the structure and flow of data in an organization. Focuses on scalability, performance, and the overall blueprint of data systems.
  Data Engineer: Implements and maintains the systems designed by the Data Architect, ensuring data pipelines are efficient.
  Data Scientist: Uses data to develop models and provide insights but doesnâ€™t generally design the architecture.

1.3 Real-World Example
  Company Scenario: An e-commerce platform is growing rapidly. The company collects massive amounts of customer data, transaction logs, 
  and product details. The Data Architect is responsible for designing a system that can scale as the company grows, 
  ensuring high availability, and enabling efficient querying for analytics.
