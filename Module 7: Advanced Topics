7.1 Real-Time Data Architecture
  •	Use Cases: Real-time analytics, monitoring systems, and fraud detection.
  •	Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, AWS Kinesis.
Example: A financial institution needs to monitor transactions in real-time to detect fraud. The Data Architect designs a real-time streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka to ingest and process data in real-time.

7.2 Machine Learning Integration
  •	Data Pipeline for Machine Learning: Building pipelines that integrate machine learning models into the data architecture, enabling predictive analytics.
  •	Tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch, MLflow, Kubeflow.
Example: For a retail business, integrating a recommendation system to suggest products to users based on historical data.
